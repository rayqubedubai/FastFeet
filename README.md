### Installation and Setup

**Software Setup**
The game is installed with 2 configuration files  `settings.txt` and `Arduino.json`, you can find them instaled at `Documents/Github/FastFeet`.   

-	To configure the game *timer* or *score multiplier*, open `settings.txt` and edit the values like the following :  

	```
	{
	"Timer":30,
	"ScorePerGoal":5
	}
	```

	this will make the game run for 30seconds , and each goal scores 5 points.

-	To configure the hardware sensors data, open `Arduino.json` with a text editor, and move to the `Hardware Installation` step below:

**Hardware Installation**  
0- Unplug all the connected arduino sensors.  
1- Connect the USB HUB to PC and PowerPlug.  
2- Connect **ONLY ONE** arduino device into the USB hub.  
3- Open Device Manager and take note of the Port number (i.e COM25) as shown below :

4- Go back to `Arduino.json` file and change the first record to be the following :

5- Repeat the previous 2 steps by adding an arduino sensor *ONE AT A TIME* and writing the coresponding `Port number` *In The Order From Left To Right*.

6- Save the file and restart the game, and test it by playing one game, the Lights should turn off in sequence from Left to Right.
